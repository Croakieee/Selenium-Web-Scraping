# Advanced Selenium Web Scraping

This Ruby script demonstrates advanced web scraping using Selenium. It opens the Google homepage, performs a search, captures a screenshot, and retrieves titles of the first few search results.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary gem:

   ```bash
   gem install selenium-webdriver

Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and place it in your PATH. For example, you can download the ChromeDriver from here.

Run the script:
ruby advanced_selenium_script.rb

Check the generated screenshot.png for the captured screenshot.
